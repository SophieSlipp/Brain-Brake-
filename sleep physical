		<p>Each age group has a different amount of sleep that is recommended.</p>
		  <li>Those between the ages of 3 and 5 should get 11 to 13 hours of sleep.</li> 
		  <li>5 to 10 year olds should get 10 or 11 hours of sleep.</li> 
		  <li>Adolescents between the ages of 10 and 17 should normally get 8 to 10 hours of sleep.</li>
		  <li>Adults from ages 18 to 64 should get 7 to 9 hours of sleep.</li>
		  <li>Those who are ages 65+ should get 7 to 8 hours of sleep.</li>
		<p>Sleep also has a prominent effect on hormones. Sleep loss has a significant impact on the stress hormone cortisol, the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), leptin, ghrelin, and many others. With a decreased amount of sleep, the stress hormone cortisol decreases exponentially slower than normal. TSH is the hormone that stimulates the thyroid which is what regulates energy consumption in the body. With less sleep, TSH is greatly decreased. This can cause an overactive thyroid which may lead to weight loss, an increase in palpitations and anxiety, and possibly a slightly enlarged thyroid. With lack of sleep, there are also changes in leptin and ghrelin - leptin is decreased and ghrelin is increased - causing an increased appetite. Sleep loss affects many other hormones as well, which can lead to a bunch of unwanted health implications.</p>
